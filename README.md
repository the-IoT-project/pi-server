# pi-server
Repo for the Node server that will reside on the RaspberryPi

ToDo:
* Auth.js line 58 - Need to set the authURL once front end is deployed.
* User.js code may not work with Arduino - just there for reference. May need updating.
* Test.js line 12 - Need to update to reflect the PI server and not heroku example
* Create all Views once angular front end created
* travis.yml needs to be updated re test and deploy. Uncertain how to deploy to the Pi.
* App.js - need to update lines 27-29 with mongodb info (replacing knex/postgres boilerplate)
* App.js - need to update all app.use lines 79-83 once angular front end is created
* mongo_crud.js - needs to be completely reworked
